**KiFi: Bringing DeFi Functionality to NFTs**

**README**

**Inspiration:**
KiFi aims to bridge the gap between DeFi and the NFT space by offering a platform where NFT owners can earn yield on their assets.

**What it Does:**
KiFi provides a borrowing and lending marketplace specifically designed for NFTs. NFT owners can lend their assets to enthusiasts, who can then lease these pieces for bragging rights or other associated perks, all while earning passive yield.

**How We Built It:**
We utilized Hardhat to develop KiFi, focusing on integrating additional ownership functionalities atop the OpenZeppelin version.

**Challenges We Ran Into:**
Our main challenge revolved around incorporating supplementary ownership features onto the existing OpenZeppelin framework.

**Accomplishments That We're Proud Of:**
We successfully created a proof of concept where users can borrow and lend NFTs, showcasing the viability of the platform.

**What We Learned:**
Through the development process, we gained insights into implementing new functionalities within the NFT ecosystem, further expanding our understanding of the space.

**What's Next for KiFi:**
- Implementing features such as reserving future lease slots in advance.
- Organizing charity auctions for lease slots.
- Exploring the concept of pooling NFTs and distributing lease terms randomly.
- Transitioning towards a governance system for repossession, enhancing security and reliability within the platform.
